This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Dockerfiles that can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The original Dockerfile uses an outdated Ubuntu base image, fails to specify the Python version, and doesn't optimize for image size and security. The improved version addresses these issues by using a more recent, slimmer base image, specifying the Python version, and cleaning up unused packages.
